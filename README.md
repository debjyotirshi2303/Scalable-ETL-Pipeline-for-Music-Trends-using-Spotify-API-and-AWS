# Scalable-ETL-Pipeline-for-Music-Trends-using-Spotify-API-and-AWS
This project builds a serverless ETL pipeline using Python and AWS to analyze weekly top songs from Spotify. It extracts, transforms, and stores data in Amazon S3, catalogs it with AWS Glue, and uses Amazon Athena for querying. The goal is to understand music trends over time by creating a comprehensive dataset.
